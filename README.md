## 🔮 Future Scope

As Pastu grows, we envision transforming it from a simple pastebin into a powerful **developer productivity hub**. Here's what's next:

- 🤖 **Smart Paste Suggestions**  
  Leverage AI to auto-tag code snippets, recommend best practices, and detect potential bugs in pasted code.

- 📂 **Project Snippet Collections**  
  Allow users to organize multiple related pastes into folders/projects with versioning and notes.

- 🔍 **Semantic Search Engine**  
  Implement a developer-aware search that understands code context — e.g., “JavaScript debounce function.”

- 🌐 **Global Paste Index (Public Feed)**  
  Let users opt to share public pastes with the world — a Stack Overflow-style stream of useful snippets.

- 🛠️ **One-Click Export to GitHub Gists / Repositories**  
  Seamlessly push pastes to GitHub as gists or into personal repos with commit tracking.

- 📱 **Mobile App Companion**  
  Build a lightweight companion app for browsing and editing code on the go, with offline sync.

- 🔐 **Zero-Knowledge Privacy Mode**  
  Introduce encrypted pastes viewable only by the creator, ensuring maximum privacy.

- 🧩 **Plugin Ecosystem**  
  Let the community extend Pastu via plugins — e.g., terminal themes, AI integrations, or documentation tools.
